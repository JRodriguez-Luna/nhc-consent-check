<h1>Consent File Sorter (NHC Consent Check)</h1>

<p>Consent File Sorter is a Chrome Extension designed to help professionals efficiently organize client consent documents. It allows you to drag and drop multiple files, automatically sorts them into categorized folders based on a predefined checklist, and then packages the results into a downloadable ZIP archive.</p>

<p>All file handling and sorting is performed <strong>entirely in your browser</strong>, ensuring that no data is ever uploaded to a server.</p>
